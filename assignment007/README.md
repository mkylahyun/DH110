# Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype
Mikayla Noh | DH110 | Fall 2022

## Project Purpose & Process Description
The purpose of this project is to redesign Cooklist, an app that allows users to track their pantry in hopes of encouraging individual action towards reducing food waste. This interactive high-fidelity prototype aims to create a more user-friendly interface for the pantry layout to make the items that are expiring soon easily visible. It also adds a feature where users can track their expenses and food waste to give users more motivation to use the app as well as continue to consume responsibly. 

I used Figma to create this prototype and changed the interface design and flow from the previous lofi-prototype and design assignments. I kept the overall design but changed the colors to give it a more clean look. For the recipe and expense flows, I changed it to make it more simple per my previous impression test. I created less screens/clicks and incorporated a more visible interface design.

## Tasks
This interactive prototype supports 2 tasks
1. Finding items in the pantry section and seeing what items are expiring soon
2. Tracking expenses and food waste to see personal waste

## Wireflow with Graphic Design

## Updates

Based on the feedback I got while working on this assignment and the previous impression test, I changed the design of my interface. The biggest concern was how I can organize the pantry layout so that it can look properly categorized and not cluttered while working with many items, considering that the app is to track user's pantry- which usually have many items. I first changed my frame size from iPhone 8 to iPhone 13 to give the overall layout more space. I tried many iterations of different colors, which can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/5OEGBNRDuOOJ74QofOlv5U/Design-Changes), to see what color can spark excitement when using the app. The previous color choices looked too dark and not clean enough so I opted for using more cool tones, blue, with warm accents through the color yellow. I also changed the body's font style from "Mallanna" to "Rubik" following the clean look and to give it more structure.

### Flow

I changed the expenses and money tracking page to be found in "Profile" instead of in the "Pantry" options as it is a more personal feature than it is related to the Pantry. The layout of the page is also more visual as I used graphs to give users an easy summary instead of another list. I changed the wording to be more motivational as well to encourage users to continue reducing food waste rather than discourgae them from using the app and not track their pantry. I added a title for the Pantry section to give more clarity on what tab users are on instead of just having "All". I also bolded the bottom tab and made the icon bigger as it seemed too small and thin in the previous iteration.

## Cognitive Walkthrough

I conducted a cognitive walkthrough with my peers during class in Week 8. An impression test was done first, asking what they see, what they think the app is about, and what they think can be done with the app. I then briefly explained the app's purpose and uses to my two classmates and asked them to complete two tasks. The first task was to find expired items in the pantry section and to go through all the different sections. The second task was to find personal expenses and waste and see how much food waste they created. During the walkthrough, I asked if they had any comments and received feedback upon completion of tasks. Their comments and notes from the cognitive walkthrough can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YYr9-TXIdPatnHjyW8pMslZXyIW812qU6RJZJFq7wEk/edit?usp=sharing).

### Summary of Cogntive Walkthrough
Overall, the cognitive walkthrough went very well. Both my peers correctly predicted the app's purpose and were able to complete all the tasks. This showed that the app design prototype is self-explanatory, simple, and easy to use. 
> I wanted to highlight "expiring soon" items as one of the most crucial part of the app and my classmates noted that it stood out the most. 
> Since the pantry has many different items, it took time to curate the layout of the pantry section but they mentioned the app is very simple to use and feels intuitive as the design looks like a fridge.

However I ran into a new problem that I did not have during my low fidelity prototype testing. One of my classmate did not realize/expect the "expiring soon" card to be clickable and was surprised when she accidentally clicked and was taken to a new page. 
> She mentioned that drop shadows are usually for small buttons so users might not be too sure if it's clickable for "expiring soon". The "expiring soon" card didn't seem clickable. 

The drop shadows that were added were not sufficient enough to afford clickability.I plan to change the design of the "expiring soon" card by adding "view more" or an arrow next to the title so that it looks more clickable.

> Another problem that my classmate noted was that the change from one section to another was so minimal that users may not be able to easily distinguish the change. 

The layout for each section - All, Fridge, Freezer - are all similar so using different shade of color may allow user to distinguish the different sections more easily. This can improve visiblity of system status and create more differences between the sections so I think this is a good design change I can implement in my next prototype.

## Usability Testing

Before usability testing, I made some small changes to the design according to the feedback I got in the cognitive walkthrough. 
The changes include:
* Switching categories and "expiring soon" order to give more prominence to "expiring soon" card by having it in the middle of the page
* Making categories smaller and "expiring soon" larger
* Design change in "expiring soon" card to make it look more clickable
* Color change for "expiring soon" page to allow easier distinguishability between sections and cohesiveness
* Smaller categories for "expiring soon" page for more differences/distinguishability

The following usability tests were conducted over Zoom. Participants shared their screen that displayed the prototype and usability test form and followed given directions as I walked them through the test. The usability test form can be accessed [here](https://forms.gle/9goPPfEdFr3Xyd7D6). 

### Usability Test #1

My participant was a 23 year old female who enjoys cooking and has had previous experience living alone, buying groceries, and managing the pantry. She has never used Cooklist but has previous experience using other food-tracking apps for diet/health reasons. The full recording was unfortunately lost but a short test recording clip as evidence of usability test can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Twu7XgzMQJyyg_V-Wds8Yi-694c_oesp?usp=sharing). However her responses are still accessible and saved in the usability test [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6syBLpTXwPt2C4za67BNhgz-P5KgrCdi5QaDybykJTOfHMQ/viewform?usp=sharing). 

**Insights**

ðŸ’¡ **Easy to view what items are expiring soon with red 'eat by' dates**
> This participant found it very easy to navigate through the different sections and had no problem completing the first task. She was able to go through every section and found all the expiring soon items. She noted that the red texts definitely give her a sense of urgency to consume them before it goes to waste. However she suggested having a sort function to organize all items by expiring dates regardless of categories. 

ðŸ’¡ **Confusing title and number for "food waste" graph**
> When doing the second task, she mentioned that since the number and graph visually come to her eyes first, she thought that the number was percentage of food waste. The smaller text below further explains the graph but reading the text comes secondary so she struggled a bit at first. She also noted that the red colored part of the graph depicts the food waste/ potential waste pretty well but wished the graph was a bit more clear.

ðŸ’¡ **Categories for expenses and waste**

She was able to complete the second task as well, and enjoyed the feature to see weekly and monthly reports for expenses and waste. However for each, she suggested having a feature that separates the spending/waste even more by categories so that she can see how much of what she buys the most/least as well as how much of what she wastes often. 

## Usability Test #2

My second usability test participant was a 25 year old male who currently works and lives with a roommate. He enjoys eating and grocery shops every couple weeks. Due to his love for food, he tends to produce very little to no food waste and tries to cook at home whenever he is able to. He has never used a pantry tracking or any diet-related tracking apps before. The link to the usability test recording can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dkGy9TWZbYJrQ46dUEbwo6qrIpw34Gvq?usp=sharing). 

**Insights**

ðŸ’¡ **Clicking dropdown menu**


ðŸ’¡ **Viewing expenses and waste**
> The participant was not able to find where to view expenses and waste on his first try. He first looked in the bottom navigation tab and clicked on "Shop". However he clicked on the profile icon after his initial attempt and was able to locate it. He mentioned that he was a bit taken aback when the profile icon immediately displayed the expenses and waste. He did not expect to see it right away and said it was a bit odd as he is used to seeing more menus and options in "profile" view. 

If this becomes a reoccuring problem in my future usability tests, I am considering making a new tab in the navigation bar for viewing personal expenses and waste. I think it's an important and useful feature in the app that can motivate users to continue tracking their pantry so having it more visible may be a good idea.

ðŸ’¡ **Ability to see progress and each day's spending**
> He was very enthusiastic about the personal expenses and waste feature. He mentioned that although he uses other finance apps, they usually have all categories of spending so it is nice to be able to specifically see a graph for grocery expenses. He did not have any difficulty completing the second task but he preferred seeing each day for the week's report rather than just the total. Since some users grocery shop everyday, it would be better to see spending for each day rather than a total. He also thought he would be able to use the arrows to view previous months/weeks. He suggested it would be even more motivating to see history and view personal progress.

I plan to add a bar or line graph that displays each day of expense/waste for the week in my next updated prototype. I also think being able to see progress would be a nice feature to have and plan to add another graph that can display each month. It can notify users how much they have saved/reduced waste compared to the previous month and can encourage living sustainably.
