# Assignmnet 01: Heuristic Evaluation

## Tentative Tile: Sustainable Eating
### About the Project - Responsible Consumption and Production
The UN states that each year an estimated 1/3 of all food produced, which is equivalent to 1.3 billion tons, is wasted. We’ve all produced food waste at least once in our lives, either by letting our fruits and vegetables spoil or ordering more than we can eat at restaurants. Especially in big cities, we are surrounded by abundance of food that we do not realize how harmful wasting food is to our environment. According to the [UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/), the food sector is responsible for about 30% of the world’s total energy consumption and about 22% of total Greenhouse Gas emissions. We need to realize that food production uses great amounts of our resources and energy so when we waste food, we are wasting all the resources that went into the production as well as increasing green house gas emissions. 

At the cost of depleting our natural resources, we’re consuming and producing more to fuel the global economy thus creating as much waste. A step everyone can make towards responsible consumption and production is to live sustainably by reducing waste and learning waste management. For this project, I will be focusing on how we can adapt a sustainable lifestyle to reduce food waste and make responsible choices in managing food for a more sustainable future.

## Website 1: [Further with Food](https://www.furtherwithfood.org/)

### About
Further with Food is a center for food loss and waste solutions, devoted to reducing food waste, feeding hungry people, and diverting food to its most beneficial use. Users from businesses to investors and individuals are able to gain information about food loss and waste in the United States as well as solutions to reduce it from the many resources they provide. Further with Food also serves as a community platform where users can find and share information about proven solutions and innovate new approaches to combat food waste. 

The website was initiated and is supported by a public-private partnership composed of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Feeding America, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, World Resources Institute, and many more credible, official organizations. 

### Overall Evaluation
Although the website contains and provides a lot of valuable information, the poor organization of the resources makes it overwhelming to use and incomprehensible. The website feels outdated and the solutions they provide do not seem tangible. A better organization of resources can help the website be more practical with their goals.

| **1\. Visibility of system status**<br>The website clearly informs the user about its current status                                                                            | The website shades in the menu that the mouse hovers over but after a user enters a page, there is no other indication than the filter bar on the left to let users know which page they are in.                                                                 |                          |2
| **2\. Match between system and the real world**<br>The website uses language that is familiar to the user and presents information in a way that is analogous to the real world | **Good**: The site uses terms like "My Dashboard", "My Training", "My Tasks", "My Stories"<br>**Bad**: The page for writing stories is called the "Creativity Center" which may not be intuitive to all users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Rename the "Creativity Center" to the "Writing Center" or give it another more intuitive name.                                                                                      | 1                         |
| **3\. User control and freedom**<br>The website gives users a way to easily undo an unwanted action                                                                             | **Good**: The text input box for stories allows the user to undo an action by using the "ctrl+z" keys<br>**Bad**: The only way to undo an action in the text box is with "ctrl+z", there are no buttons for the user to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Add a reverse arrow and a forward arrow that the users can click on to undo and redo their work.                                                                                    | 2                         |

These menu options collapse into a sidebar with three lines when the window width is narrow.<br>**Good**: Clicking on "TimeSlips" on the top of any page takes the user back to the home page.<br>**Bad**: The sidebar menu is a standard convention, but may be more difficult for seniors to navigate than having options available at the top of the page.                 | Leave the menu options at the top no matter what the screen width is or replace the three lines that indicate menu say "Menu" instead.                                              | 3                         |
| **5\. Error prevention**<br>The website prevents errors by reducing error-prone conditions or checking for them and notifying the user                                          | **Bad**: The text input box for storytelling does not have spelling and grammar check options.<br>**Bad**: On the storytelling page, the site lets me navigate to a new page without saving my work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Have a pop-up message appear to let the user know that they have not saved their work before navigating to a new page.                                                              | 3                         |

There is a lot of "extra" information that pertains to the organization that makes it hard to find the information that is for the storytelling.                                                                                                                                              | Make the "Creativity Center" a main menu option.                                                                                                                                    | 3                         |
| **9\. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**<br>The website provides clear error messages that state the problem and potential solutions                     | **Good**: If the user provides incorrect sign in information, the site tells the user that they have "Invalid Email or password"<br>**Bad**: The site does not specify which input is invalid and leaves the email address provided filled in, even if it is incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                       | Let the user know if the email isn't recognized or if the password is incorrect, and provide users with ways to resolve both errors.                                                | 2                         |
