# Cooklist App UX Redesign
## Mikayla Noh

### Introduction
For the 2022 Spring quarter in Digital Humanities 110, students were given 6 design challenges in regards to United Nation's sustainable development plan to choose from. Out of the choices, I decided to focus on Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production. While conducting research on this topic, I read from the UN [website](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12), stating how each year, an estimated 1/3 of all food produced - equivalent to 1.3 billion tons - is wasted. 

We’ve all produced food waste at least once in our lives, either by letting our fruits and vegetables spoil or ordering more than we can eat at restaurants and I realized that feasible plans can be made to minimize this harm. While pondering on how we can adapt a sustainable lifestle to reduce food waste and make responsible choices in managing food for a more sustainable future, I came arcross Cooklist, a pantry tracking app. The individual action of responsible pantry tracking to reduce food waste sounded realistic and attainable. I hope to contribute with my UX Design, an app that can encourage sustainble lifestyles by offering practical methods to reduce waste through easy and motivating food management. 

### Design Statement
Especially in big cities, we are surrounded by abundance of food that we do not realize how harmful wasting food is to our environment. However, the food sector is responsible for about 30% of the world’s total energy consumption and about 22% of total greenhouse gas emissions. This means that we are wasting all the resources that went into production as well as increasing greenhouse gas emissions whenever food is wasted. At the cost of depleting our natural resources, we’re consuming and producing more to fuel the global economy. Food waste is something most people are not too conscious of as food consumption is part of our daily lives. It is easily overlooked but this individual action of responsible consumption can contribute in reducing energy and help build a more sustainable future.

### Competitor Analysis
## Heuristic Evaluation
To generally see how food waste was being combatted, I conducted heuristic evaluations on two websites: [Further with Food](https://www.furtherwithfood.org/) and [Imperfect Foods](https://www.imperfectfoods.com/). 
* Further with Foods is a center for food loss and waste solutions, devoted to reducing food waste, feeding hungry people, and diverting food to its most beneficial use. The website contains and provides a lot of valuable information, but the poor organization of the resources makes it overwhelming to use and incomprehensible. The website overall felt very outdated and the solutions provided did not seem as tangible. 
* Imperfect Foods is a website that encourages sustainability and reduces food waste by providing grocery delivery services with imperfect foods that would've gone to waste. The website is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use overall and provides good information on food waste for consumers to educate themselves. However the lack of user control and freedom makes the website difficult to use and can frustrate some users that may want to exit out of the sign-up process and just browse.

## Usability Testing

### User Research - Contextual Inquiry
After some analysis through heuristic evaluations and usability testing, I wanted to gain a better understanding of the user's needs and behaviors. To learn about this, I conducted an interivew with a 25 year old male who lives alone and frequently grocery shops. I developed a set of questions that were asked while my participant used the Cooklist app to understand their needs and gain insight on user pain points. I also designed an activity for my participant to observe how my participant organizes his pantry. This activity was done following the interview, where I observed him at the comfort of his home, in efforts of gaining a better understanding of his behavior...

### UX Storytelling
## Persona + Scenario
Although cooking and eating is part of our daily lives, everyone has their own unique ways of organizing the pantry, buying groceries, and tracking food waste. It is pertinent to think about these factors in different perspectives to further learn what can be done to make a product more usable. We all have different lifestyles so created personas and scenarios to consider these differences and account for all possible pain points and ways to help different users with various lifestyles...

### Low-fidelity Prototype
Food waste is very commonly produced by every individual yet easily avoidable through proper pantry tracking. In efforts of improving Cooklist for users to make it more usable and motivating, I created a low-fidelity prototype first. The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping is to test how users will interact with an application in the early stages of design. I hoped to learn from their feedbacks and interactions and revise accordingly to further improve the application’s usability. 

Keeping the personas and usage scenario in mind, I came up with three features they could find useful in solving their problems:

* Layout that shows clear indication of expiration dates and organized categories
* Waste indicator that shows how much money user is wasting as well as the environmental harm user is causing from food waste
* Quick recipe feature where users can quickly add personal recipes

With the persona's perspectives and scenarios, I was able to have a general idea of the screen designs so I translated them onto my tablet to create my initial wireframes for my low-fidelity prototype.  [read more...](https://mkylahyun.github.io/DH110/assignment005)

### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation
## Wireframe
Although pantry tracking seems like an easy task, users often feel overwhelmed by the amount of information that is shown in the main screen. By clearly showing what items are expiring soon, users are able to quickly grasp this information. Visibly showing categories can also help with the feeling of overwhelmingness as they can easily navigate the app and accomplish their task. Below is one of the task's wireframe version. The completed scenarios and tasks can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/leVkul1V7MAmqo8Sa6U1N6/DH110-Assignment07-Wireframes-with-GUI?node-id=139%3A32488&t=EyaX01R1hxoi5wh9-0).

## Graphic Design Element Variation
While creating the prototype, I tested many different graphic design element variations including typography, shape, color, and light/dark modes... [read more...](https://mkylahyun.github.io/DH110/assignment006)

Below is a shape variation that I tested when designing.

The complete wireflow of the 2 tasks and an additional task that is not included in the interactive prototype can be seen below. The wireflow can also be seen here in Figma.

### High-Fidelity Prototype
In hopes of encouraging individual action towards reducing food waste, I created this interactive high-fidelity prototype that can provide a more user-friendly interface for the pantry layout to make the items that are expiring soon easily visible. I also added a feature where users can track their expenses and food waste to give users more motivation to use the app as well as continue to consume responsibly.

I used Figma to create this prototype and changed the interface design and flow from the previous lofi-prototype and design assignments. I kept the overall design but changed the colors to give it a more clean look. For the recipe and expense flows, I changed it to make it more simple per my previous impression test. I created less screens/clicks and incorporated a more visible interface design.

This interactive prototype supports 2 tasks:

1. Finding items in the pantry section and seeing what items are expiring soon
2. Tracking expenses and food waste to see personal progress
