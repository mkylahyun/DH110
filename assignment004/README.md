# Assignment 04: UX Storytelling
Mikayla Noh | DH110 | Fall 2022

## Purpose of UX Storytelling
> Although cooking and eating is part of our daily lives, everyone has their own unique ways of organizing the pantry, buying groceries, and tracking food waste. It is pertinent to think about these factors in different perspectives to further learn what can be done to make a product more usable. We all have different lifestyles so the purpose of UX storytelling in my project is to consider these differences and account for all possible pain points and ways to help different users with various lifestyles.

## Proposing Design Features
Based on user research from previous assignments, users frequently feel overwhelmed by the layout of the pantry in the pantry section of the app. Another issue is the lack of motivation for users to continue using Cooklist to track their pantry.
* **Pantry Layout:** Implement more minimal design and better categories for clear organization
* **Incentives:** Include other features that can motivate users to continue using the app such as allowing users to be aware to money and energy waste

## Scenario & Journey Map

### 1. Lucy's Scenario & Journey Map

#### Why?
> Lucy is a mother of 3 children, wife to husband, and a diligent high school counselor. Due to her big family she goes grocery shopping every week and tends to overbuy without realizing she already has the same item at home. The fridge is always very full so she has a hard time organizing and keeping track of the pantry. She finds expired pantry items very often, hidden behind in the fridge by all the other items. Lucy also wants to provide healthy and nutritious food for her family but it becomes difficult to think of new recipes using similar ingredients. She wants to easily see what is availble in the pantry as well as document her own recipes to see what can be made. 

#### How?
> She hears about Cooklist and decides to download it. She opens the app and adds her pantry items by pressing the plus sign. She succesfully adds all the items and is returned to her pantry home page. She can easily see what items are expiring soon with the dates and her pantry items are neatly organized into its respective categories. She clicks on “Dairy” and sees a list of all her avaiable dairy products organized by name, quantity, and expiration date. She then clicks on the arrow next to “All” and sees the drop down menu for Fridge, Freezer, and Pantry. She can now separately view what is available in each section. Lucy then inputs her personal recipe by pressing on the plus sign in the meal plan tab. She selects all the ingredients using the search function and then moves on to the quanity section to choose the measurements. She is too busy so she skips writing in the steps for her recipe. Recommended serving size is shown and she is able to customize her recipe.

### 2. Daniel's Scenario & Journey Map

#### Why?
> Daniel finally has some time and opens the fridge to make some dinner only to realize that all the produces have gone bad. He ends up wasting even more money buying groceries and ordering food. He wants to simplify his grocery list to minimize spending while still having the option to cook different recipes. He wishes that he had known his produces were going bad so that he could’ve used them earlier. 

#### How? 
> He goes on his phone and opens the Cooklist app. He sees the list of “expiring soon” pantry items that he was not aware of. He goes to his profile and clicks on “notification” to allow notification for “expiring soon”. Now he gets an alert when items are expiring and as soon as he opens the app, he sees the “expiring soon” category with respective items along with the dates. He clicks on “view all” at the top right corner to see the full list. He swipes right to the “waste” section to see the potential amount of money and energy wasted if he does not use the items soon. He is shocked and feels more motivated to track his pantry after seeing how much money and energy is being wasted due to food waste. He never realized the environmental harm it can cause and felt like his individual action of producing less food waste can slightly help to build a more sustainable future. He adds ingredients of one dish to his shopping list and presses the “chef” icon to see the potential
